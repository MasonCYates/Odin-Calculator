# Odin-Calculator
In this project of the foundations course I will be creating a calculator that you can use on page to do different math equations!


What we need. These are the Odin courses instructions.

 - Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find 
   on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items and testing them in your browser’s console.
    add
    subtract
    multiply
    divide
 - Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
 - Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an “Equals” key.
    Do not worry about wiring up the JS just yet.
    There should also be a display for the calculator. Go ahead and fill it with some dummy numbers so it looks correct.
    Add a “clear” button.
 - Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons. You should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for 
   use in the next step.
 - Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator, 
   and also save which operation has been chosen and then operate() on them when the user presses the “=” key.
    You should already have the code that can populate the display, so once operate() has been called, update the display with the ‘solution’ to the operation.
    This is the hardest part of the project. You need to figure out how to store all the values and call the operate function with them. Don’t feel bad if it takes you a while to figure out the logic.

Items Completed
Im starting work on this tonight 9/3/22 after I get off work I will work from 11pm to around 3 am on it and all day tomorrow. 
My goal is to finish this project on 9/4/22 Im going to challenge myself to not only commit often I want top try to comment in my code more.

item 1{Working on}
item 2{not started}
item 3{not started}

item 5{not started}

- Finish project before Midnight 9/4/22. ()

This project is going to help me learn more about javascript coding better readme creation and also better commenting in my code to explain.

Thank you for anyone who examines this and reads this thank you for your time and checking out my journey to becoming a master of code and my attempt to land a great job.
